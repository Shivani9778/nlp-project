# NLTK Text Processing Example

This project demonstrates basic text processing techniques using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The script performs sentence tokenization, word tokenization, stop word removal, and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging on a given text.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need the NLTK library, which can be installed via pip if you haven't done so already:

```bash
pip install nltk
